Hey there! 
I am an undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, and particularly in Generative Networks and Few Shot Learning. I am currently working with Prof. Vinay Namboodiri in Delta Lab, IITK on the task of Incremental Learning. You can go through my CV to look at my past internships and projects.

Apart from my academic pursuits I love playing and watching football and I am also a Manchester United fan.
