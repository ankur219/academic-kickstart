Hey there! 
I am a junior undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department(I wish I could change that. I hate it!) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I am broadly interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, though I love football more. But my parents said I can't make a future out of it. That's how I am stuck over here. I have done some internships and a few projects in Computer Vision, but it's all given in my CV. So, let's skip it.


I am a Manchester United fan though. Life isn't easy for us guys. Plus the academics at my college is making it tougher. Too much depression XD. Naahh, I am happy on most of the days. Except, when my team loses or you know, there is an exam next day :p
